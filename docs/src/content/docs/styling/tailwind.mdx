title: Flexilla - Tailwind Plugin
description: Simplified styling for Flexilla with variants and components
---


## Introduction

### Using Tailwind3

The `@flexilla/tailwind-plugin` provides simplified variants and essential components for styling elements in the Flexilla library. Instead of writing verbose attribute-based styling like `data-[state=open]:some-class`, this plugin introduces easy-to-use variants, such as `fx-open:some-class`. Additionally, it includes predefined components like overlays, tab indicators, and animated modal content for quick implementation of common UI features.

## Installation

To get started, install the `@flexilla/tailwind-plugin` using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm i -D @flexilla/tailwind-plugin
```

Then, include it in your TailwindCSS configuration:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('@flexilla/tailwind-plugin'),
    // other plugins...
  ],
}
```

### With Tailwind4

Just include these variants in your main tailwind config CSS file.

```css

```

## Variants

The plugin offers a range of variants that allow you to conditionally style elements based on the `data-state` attribute. The variants are prefixed with `fx-` to make the syntax concise and easy to use.

### Available State Variants

Here are the supported state variants:

- `fx-open` : data-state=open
- `fx-closed` : data-state=closed
- `fx-active`
- `fx-inactive`
- `fx-visible`
- `fx-hidden`

And their negations:

- `fx-not-open`
- `fx-not-active`
- `fx-not-visible`
- and more...

### Example Usage

Instead of writing:

```html
<div class="data-[state=open]:bg-green-500"></div>
```

You can simply write:

```html
<div class="fx-open:bg-green-500"></div>
```

The plugin also supports `peer-` and `group-` variants, allowing you to target peer or grouped elements based on the same states:

```html
<div class="group">
    <div class="peer-fx-open:bg-blue-500 group-fx-active:text-white"></div>
</div>
```

## Components

The `@flexilla/tailwind-plugin` also includes essential UI components, each with predefined styles to speed up your development.

### Popper

The `ui-popper` component positions elements based on custom CSS variables:

```html
<div class="ui-popper">
  <!-- Popper content -->
</div>
```

For an absolute positioned popper, use:

```html
<div class="ui-popper-absolute">
  <!-- Popper content -->
</div>
```

### Animated Modal Content

The `ui-animated-modal-content` class adds required styles in can you need to add animation to the modal content

```html
<div class="ui-animated-modal-content">
  <!-- Modal content -->
</div>
```

### Animated Tab Panel

Use the `ui-animated-tab-panel` same as `ui-animated-modal-content` but for tabs transitions:

```html
<div class="ui-animated-tab-panel">
  <!-- Tab panel content -->
</div>
```

### Tabs Indicator

For styling tab indicators, use the `ui-tabs-indicator` class. It allows for dynamic positioning and sizing through CSS variables:

```html
<div class="ui-tabs-indicator"></div>
```

### Overlay

The `ui-overlay` provides a fixed overlay for modals or other UI elements:

```html
<div class="ui-overlay">
  <!-- Overlay content -->
</div>
```
