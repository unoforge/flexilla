title: Flexilla UnoCSS Plugin
description: Simplified styling for Flexilla using UnoCSS with customizable state variants and components.
---



## Introduction

The `@unifydev/flexilla` for UnoCSS provides simplified state-based variants and essential components, making styling easier and more efficient. By default, the state variants are prefixed with `fx`, but this can be customized based on your needs.

Instead of verbose attribute-based syntax like `data-[state=open]:some-class`, you can use concise, readable variants such as `fx-open:some-class`. Additionally, it offers pre-defined components like overlays, tab indicators, and animated modal content.

## Installation

To get started, install the plugin using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @unifydev/flexilla
```

Include it in your UnoCSS configuration:

```js
// uno.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'unocss';
import flexilla from "@unifydev/flexilla;

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    flexilla({ prefix: 'fx' }), // you can customize the prefix here
  ],
});
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the prefix used for state variants by passing options to the plugin. For example, to change the prefix to `ui`:

```js
import flexilla from "@unifydev/flexilla";

export default defineConfig({
  presets: [
    flexilla({ prefix: 'ui' }), // now use ui-open:some-class
  ],
});
```


## Variants

The plugin offers a range of variants that allow you to conditionally style elements based on the `data-state` attribute. The variants are prefixed with `fx-` to make the syntax concise and easy to use.

### Available State Variants

Here are the supported state variants:

- `fx-open` : data-state=open
- `fx-closed` : data-state=closed
- `fx-active`
- `fx-inactive`
- `fx-visible`
- `fx-hidden`

And their negations:

- `fx-not-open`
- `fx-not-active`
- `fx-not-visible`
- and more...

### Example Usage

Instead of writing:

```html
<div class="data-[state=open]:bg-green-500"></div>
```

You can simply write:

```html
<div class="fx-open:bg-green-500"></div>
```

The plugin also supports `peer-` and `group-` variants, allowing you to target peer or grouped elements based on the same states:

```html
<div class="group">
    <div class="peer-fx-open:bg-blue-500 group-fx-active:text-white"></div>
</div>
```

## Components

The `@unifydev/flexilla` also includes essential UI components, each with predefined styles to speed up your development.

### Popper

The `ui-popper` component positions elements based on custom CSS variables:

```html
<div class="ui-popper">
  <!-- Popper content -->
</div>
```


### Animated Modal Content

The `ui-animated-modal-content` class adds required styles in can you need to add animation to the modal content

```html
<div class="ui-animated-modal-content">
  <!-- Modal content -->
</div>
```

### Animated Tab Panel

Use the `ui-animated-tab-panel` same as `ui-animated-modal-content` but for tabs transitions:

```html
<div class="ui-animated-tab-panel">
  <!-- Tab panel content -->
</div>
```

### Tabs Indicator

For styling tab indicators, use the `ui-tabs-indicator` class. It allows for dynamic positioning and sizing through CSS variables:

```html
<div class="ui-tabs-indicator"></div>
```

### Overlay

The `ui-overlay` provides a fixed overlay for modals or other UI elements:

```html
<div class="ui-overlay">
  <!-- Overlay content -->
</div>
```
