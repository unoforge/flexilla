## Introduction

Flexilla is a headless, CSS framework-agnostic library designed to manage interactive components like dropdowns, collapses, and tabs. 

It provides seamless integration with any CSS framework, including TailwindCSS and UnoCSS.

## Principles

Flexilla doesn't use any CSS Framework, it's just update states via data attributes, you can directly specify style on the component according to it's state (for an accordion: each item has a data-open attribute wich can be close or open, and eache item has trigger `aria-expended="true"` or `aria-expended="false"` and content `data-state="open"` or `data-state="close"`)
